# Single-cell analysis

## Introduction
### Why scRNA-seq
1. explore which cell types are present in a tissue
2. identify unknown/rare cell types or states
3. elucidate the changes in gene expression during differentiation processes or across time or states
4. identify genes that are differentially expressed in particular cell types between conditions (e.g. treatment or disease)
5. explore changes in expression among a cell type while incorporating spatial, regulatory, and/or protein information

### Challenges of scRNA-seq analysis
1. Large volume of data
2. Low depth of sequencing per cell
3. Biological variability across cells/samples

4. Technical variability across cells/samples
