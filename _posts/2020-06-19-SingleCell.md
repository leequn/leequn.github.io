# Single-cell analysis

## Introduction
### Why scRNA-seq
- explore which cell types are present in a tissue
- identify unknown/rare cell types or states
- elucidate the changes in gene expression during differentiation processes or across time or states
- identify genes that are differentially expressed in particular cell types between conditions (e.g. treatment or disease)
- explore changes in expression among a cell type while incorporating spatial, regulatory, and/or protein information

### Challenges of scRNA-seq analysis
- Large volume of data
- Low depth of sequencing per cell
- Biological variability across cells/samples
	- Transcriptional bursting
	- Varying rates of RNA processing
	- Continuous or discrete cell identities (e.g. the pro-inflammatory potential of each individual T cell)
	- Environmental stimuli
	- Temporal changes
- Technical variability across cells/samples
	- Cell-specific capture efficiency
	- Library quality
	- Amplification bias
	- Batch effects
